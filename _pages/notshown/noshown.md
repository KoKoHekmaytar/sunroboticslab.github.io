The mission of Sun robotics lab at ASU is to advance science and technology in robotics for addressing grand societal challenges in manufacturing, daily life, and health care. We are a highly interdisciplinary research group with expertise in design, modeling, and control. A major focus of our current research is the study of robotic actuation such as developing and controlling artificial muscle and artificial-muscle-driven robots --- a new generation of robots that are powerefficient, multifunctional, compliant, and autonomous in ways that are similar to biological organisms. 

Our lab is a people-first lab with the core values of: respect, understanding, transparency, and supportive! We not only train junior robotics engineers and researchers to conduct research on robotics, but more importantly support them to have a better life!
