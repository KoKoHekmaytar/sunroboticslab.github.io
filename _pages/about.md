The mission of Sun robotics lab at ASU is to advance science and technology in robotics for addressing grand societal challenges in manufacturing, daily life, and health care. We are a highly interdisciplinary research group with expertise in design, modeling, and control. A major focus of our current research is the study and development of soft actuators and systems (muscle and body) to better inteegrate with computational intelligence (brain). 

We have fully supported PhD openings, please see the
