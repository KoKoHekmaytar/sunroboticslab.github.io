#### Summer Research Initiative 2024 (SURI) program

The Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University offers summer opportunities for qualified students to gain engineering research experience at a top research university. Participants acquire an in-depth understanding of what it would be like to pursue a doctoral degree through a full-time (30 to 40 hours/week) eight-week summer research program.

Eligible U.S. citizens, permanent residents, ASU-sponsored F-1/J-1 visa students and international applicants receive **a $5,000 stipend**, housing and some living expenses. Research projects across a wide range of engineering fields are available.

Students between the junior and senior years of their undergraduate degree and those pursuing masterâ€™s degrees who are considering pursuing a doctorate will be given highest consideration. Participants work under the mentorship of research faculty for the eight-week long research program and have opportunities to network with industry partners, other faculty and their peers through a variety of events and activities.

Tentative program dates for summer 2024 are May 28 to July 19 and subject to change.

**Our lab will hire two students** please find [detailed project info here](https://arizonastateu-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jsun165_asurite_asu_edu/Ebw2ZPCLHXxCpPaO5GEaK3cBVOC_rpbjRCvQf8naAkY52Q?e=5g3UAz)

#### Interviews
We usually have several rounds of interviews. Please refer to the [post: student admission process]({% post_url 2023-09-05-student-admission %})


We acknowledge that maintaining an __inclusive environment__ requires ongoing and active effort, and we are dedicated to continually learning and improving our support for diversity and inclusion. We value the experiences and perspectives of all members of our community and believe that a diverse and inclusive culture is crucial for fostering excellence in research and achieving our goals

#### Undergraduate students:

We welcome undergraduate students who are interested in gaining research experience in the areas of robot design, microcontrollers, mechanics, and control. Due to the significant amount of training required, we prefer students who are interested in longer-term (one year or more) research projects.
ASU undergraduate students are encouraged to email your interest and experience directly to Prof. Sun.

#### Q & A

__What is the advising style?__
At Sun Robotics Lab, we are dedicated to nurturing creativity, promoting collaboration, and achieving academic excellence among our students. We strongly encourage collaboration among group members and with external teams.
Each group member will have regular discussions with the PI regarding their research ideas and progress. We will assign an independent project/task to each incoming student. As students gain expertise in the field, we expect them to identify new and exciting research directions and lead their own projects.
We will have a weekly group meeting to discuss research ideas and literature studies, and we will also set up a weekly or biweekly meeting with each group member to discuss their progress and provide individual support.



 __I am a K-12 student/teacher__ and would like information for a school report, tour, help with my robotics team, a research internship, etc. My students and I are very excited about using robotics as a teaching tool to encourage interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) topics. We actively involved in outreach and are have an outreach webpage to answer your questions.


__Visiting scholars/summer research interns__ are welcome to email Prof. Sun directly for available opportunities.
