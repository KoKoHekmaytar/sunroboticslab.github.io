#### PhD students:

We are looking for highly motivated students to join our lab. 

##### How to apply:
To apply, interested candidates should submit an application to Arizona State University via [https://webapp4.asu.edu/dgsadmissions/](https://webapp4.asu.edu/dgsadmissions/), specifying their interest in working with Dr. Sun. Additionally, they should send an email titled "Prospective Ph.D. Student" or "Prospective Master Student" to jiefeng.sun@asu.edu, attaching their CV and a cover letter before submitting their application.

We usually have several rounds of interviews. Please refer to the [post: student admission process]({% post_url 2023-09-05-student-admission %})

#### Master students:


##### Masters Thesis

I am seeking multiple highly motivated Master students or undergrads to conduct theses in artificial muscle and soft robotics, starting in Summer/Fall 2024. 

To apply, interested candidates should send an email titled "Prospective Master Student for Thesis" to jiefeng.sun@asu.edu, attaching their CV, transcript, and a cover letter. Due to time limitations, Dr. Sun is **not able to** advise Masters Projects at this time. Please consider a Masters Thesis, as the opportunities for producing high-quality, publishable work is enhanced via the thesis route. 


__I am hiring multiple students to work on underwater robot and quarduped robots__

#### Undergraduate students:

We welcome undergraduate students who are interested in gaining research experience in the areas of robot design, microcontrollers, mechanics, and control. Due to the significant amount of training required, we prefer students who are interested in longer-term (one year or more) research projects.
ASU undergraduate students are encouraged to email your interest and experience directly to Dr. Sun.


##### ___Barrett Honors Thesis___
Dr. Sun has availability to serve on Barrett Thesis committees, provided the student is willing to commit to submitting their work to a conference or journal at the end of their project.

For more information, see https://barretthonors.asu.edu/academics/thesis-and-creative-project/


__Topics__\\
__1. Design of Novel Dielectric Fluid Artificial Muscle__\\
In this project, you will develop a novel artificial muscle, characterize its performance, and simulate it with physics-based simulators. Preferred skills: knowledge and hands-on experience in materials, mechanical design, and fabrication. 

**2. Real-time Control of Continuum Soft Robots with Learning to Solve Physics-based Models (With Prof. Max Ren). Fullfilled**\\
In this project, you will develop machine learning methods to solve physics-based models for controlling a continuum soft robotic arm in real time. The preferred skills are machine learning, modern control, and strong coding capability. 

__3. Fast Simulation of Soft Robots with Physics-based simulators.__ \\
In this project, you will simulate soft robots with physics-based simulators. Students who are from computer science and know numerical solvers and computer graphics (Animation and Simulation) are highly preferred. 

__4. Wearable Robots Driven by Artificial Muscles for Human Assistance and Rehabilitation (with Prof. Hyunglae Lee).__\\
In this project will design a novel artificial muscle and build a wearable robotic device for back support. The preferred skills include hands-on experience in mechatronics (circuits), mechanical design, and fabrication.

##### Funding for Master and Undergrad students

Students who are doing thesis with me will have my full support to get funding from the following programs:

[Hourly-payed grader](https://english.asu.edu/admission/graduate-admission/teaching-assistantships/gradership)
I am teaching a class every semester. Students who are doing research in my lab usually get the grader position ($15 - $16 per hour). 

[MORE (for master students)](https://students.engineering.asu.edu/graduate/research/more/)
The MORE Initiative is a unique opportunity to get involved in research during your masters experience. Please see Dr. Sun at the beginning of the semester in order to plan your MORE application. Deadline is middle of March and Oct each year. 

[FURI (for undergrads)](https://students.engineering.asu.edu/furi/)
The FURI Initiative is a unique opportunity to get involved in research during your undergrad experience. Please see Dr. Sun at the beginning of the semester in order to plan your FURI application. Deadline is middle of March and Oct each year. 

[SURI](https://students.engineering.asu.edu/graduate/research/suri/)
The student will receive **a $5,000 stipend**, housing and some living expenses during the summer each year. Deadline is Feb. 1st. I will  prioritize sudents who have already worked with me or potential PhD students. 

Hourly-paid RA: We will provide hourly-paied positions for students who have been in the lab for a while (>3 months) and perform great.

#### Q & A

__What is the advising style?__
At Sun Robotics Lab, we are dedicated to nurturing creativity, promoting collaboration, and achieving academic excellence among our students. We strongly encourage collaboration among group members and with external teams.
Each group member will have regular discussions with the PI regarding their research ideas and progress. We will assign an independent project/task to each incoming student. As students gain expertise in the field, we expect them to identify new and exciting research directions and lead their own projects.
We will have a weekly group meeting to discuss research ideas and literature studies, and we will also set up a weekly or biweekly meeting with each group member to discuss their progress and provide individual support.



 __I am a K-12 student/teacher__ and would like information for a school report, tour, help with my robotics team, a research internship, etc. My students and I are very excited about using robotics as a teaching tool to encourage interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) topics. We actively involved in outreach and are have an outreach webpage to answer your questions.


__Visiting scholars/summer research interns__ are welcome to email Dr. Sun directly for available opportunities.
