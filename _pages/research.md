Our lab will focus on the actuation of robots -- how to better drive them for motions and functionalities.
Here are our research directions

2. Artificial muscle
 - Actuators that mimic the function of biological muscle in terms of compliance and work density.


3. Artificial-muscle-driven robots
 - Soft robots
 - Shape-morphing robots (Robots that change their configurations/properties for different functionalities).

4. Modeling and control 
 - Design, modeling, and control of artificial muscle for robotic applications
 - Machine-learning-based modeling and control
