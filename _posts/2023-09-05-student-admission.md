### Student Admission Interview 
All students need to go through two rounds of interviews before they can be admitted into Sun Lab. 

#### Frist interview - 15 mins (optional)

  * In the interview, I will ask some questions in terms of your education and research (project). I will also answer your questions. 
  * The interview is 15 mins long through MicrsoftTeams. The interview could happen before or after the submission of the application. 
  

#### Formal interview - 45 mins 
  * In the interview, you will talk about your research or projects in detail. 
  * 30 mins for your presentation. 15 mins for (Q&A) answering questions from the audience (me and students in the lab).
  * If you don't have experience with research presentations, please refer to: 
     * [How to Create a Research Presentation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/HowtoCreateaResearchPresentation_000.pdf)
  
Additional interviews (e.g., paper presentation, coding assignment) could happen. 


#### Q&A
  1. **Admission process**: I don't handel admission to the programs; I will decide if you will work in our lab. I can only see your application if you are admitted by the department. The department will make the decision based on your GPA, projects, TOEFL, and  GRE.
  2. **GRE and TOEFL**: Your TOEFL should be at least 80 to meet the department's requirement. We don't have a minimum score for GRE.
