# Abstract
Physics-based simulation for soft robotic arm is based on highly nonlinear partial differential equations that are computationally expensive to resolve. Koopman operator theory provides a powerful data-driven alternative for modeling nonlinear dynamical systems in a linear framework. However, Koopman operator-based models are very highly dimensional and require considerable amounts of data to properly resolve, especially in scenarios where boundary conditions of the soft robot change. Inspired by physics-informed techniques from machine learning, we present a physics-informed approach to Koopman operator identification designed to improve identification of Koopman operator models with partially known and linearly separable physical models. The method is validated on a tendon driven soft robot with three tendons, showing orders of magnitude improved performance over standard Koopman operator identification methods for important dynamical variables such as the position along the backbone.
